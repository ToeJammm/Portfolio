				Tennessee, Knoxville. During high school, I became interested in programming, yet I still
				entered university as a graphic design major. After feeling like I wasn't being challenged
				enough, I switched my major to computer science and have fallen in love with the world of
				programming ever since. My first internship during college lasted about 7 months, where I
				learned the basics of web development and full-stack engineering. As my courses became more
				focused on specific areas of computer science, I became increasingly interested in deep
				learning and how it worked. Now, for my last year in college, almost all of my courses have
				something to do with deep learning. I hope to find a full-time position that will allow me
				to both contribute my strengths but also grow in areas that I am lacking. Feel free to check
				out my projects and send me an email if you would like to get in touch. <br> <br> Relevant Skills/Software Learned: <br> Windows, MacOS, C++, C, JavaScript, Express.JS React, Svelte, Rust, Python, PyTorch, Numpy, Pandas,
				TensorFlow, NPM, Powershell, Bash, Zsh, Git, AWS, FireBase, Azure, Adobe Creative Cloud, VSCode,
				Zed, Docker, DASH, MySQL/MSSQL,</div></div> <div class="flex hidden w-[50%] justify-center lg:mr-[45px] lg:block"><img src="senior_photo.jpeg" alt="me" class="lg:w-max-[40vw] ml-5 mr-5 max-h-[60vh] w-full rounded border-4 border-white object-cover object-top md:mr-10 md:w-[50vw] lg:mt-[92px]"></div></div></main>`;
